Simple 30MHz preselection filter, useful in superheterodyne shortwave radios. Extremely sharp stopband attenuation, approaching 90dB@~45MHz in a real-world test. Coupling between BNC cables used in the test likely accounted for loss of sharp dropoff past 40MHz. May offerr much greater stopband attenuation, given shorter transmission lines and better shielding, as would be the case on a PCB hosting a complete radio.

Air-core inductors wound on 3D printed heaxagonal formers were used as inductors. PLA plastic at minimum infill should be used for best results.
